                <aside class="hide" id="ricebowl1">The rice bowls come with a variety of toppings but the toppings that
                    are really good are the
                    fried egg, kimchi and scallions.
                    For the main meat always get the bulgogi beef, it is tender and flavorful.

                    rice.
                    The steak and shrimp hibachi is the best in my opinion and comes with vegetables and fried rice.
                    The price of the hibachi plate is $10.75.
