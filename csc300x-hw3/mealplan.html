                <aside class="shown">The spicy ramen is flavorful and comes with a variety of add-ons.
                    It is very spicy so I would stick away from this if you have a hard time with spice.
                    It is priced at $10.95.

                <aside class="hide">The rice bowls come with a variety of toppings but the toppings that
                    are really good are the
                    fried egg, kimchi and scallions.
                    For the main meat always get the bulgogi beef, it is tender and flavorful.
                    The price of this bowl is about $11.95.

                <aside class="hide">For a different rice bowl, get black beans with lettuce and tofu with
                    their white sauce.
                    This bowl comes out to about $7.95 and has as much flavor as the first one.

                <aside class="hide">The hibachi is also really good if you would like something with less
                    rice.
                    The steak and shrimp hibachi is the best in my opinion and comes with vegetables and fried rice.
                    The price of the hibachi plate is $10.75.
