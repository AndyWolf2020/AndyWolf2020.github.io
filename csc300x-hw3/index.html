        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Are you looking for places to eat on or near campus?
            Well I have the places for you.
            As a senior at UNCG, I have had plenty of time to survey the surrounding neighborhoods of UNCG and know the
            best places to eat.
            Some places may be a bit pricier than others but let me tell you, it'll be worth it.
            Hopefully you like these places as much as I did and be sure to recommend your friends to this blog if you
            did.</p>

            <h3>The Don</h3>
            <p>If you're looking for a place that has a variety of rice bowls, this is the place for you.
                They don't only sell rice bowls but other Asain dishes like ramen.
                They are open everyday except Sunday from 11-3:30pm and 5-10pm and on Saturday they are open 12-10pm.
                They are located at 423 Tate St. Below are some personal recommendations.

                <aside class="hide" id="gyoza">The gyoza that they serve are amazing.
                    They are crispy and served with a sauce that pairs really well with it.
                    The price is pretty standard for an appitizer at $8.

                <aside class="hide" id="katsu">The chicken katsu curry is just like the one my mom makes back home.

                <aside class="hide" id="ramen">The spicy ramen is flavorful and comes with a variety of add-ons.
                    It is very spicy so I would stick away from this if you have a hard time with spice.
                    It is priced at $10.95.

                Asain cuisines.

                and 2-9pm on Saturday.

            </p>
            <div class="Happy">

                    alt="ricebowl1">
                <aside class="hide" id="ricebowl1">The rice bowls come with a variety of toppings but the toppings that
                    are really good are the
                    fried egg, kimchi and scallions.
                    For the main meat always get the bulgogi beef, it is tender and flavorful.
                    The price of this bowl is about $11.95.
                </aside>
                <img class="small" id="ricebowl2" src="/AndyWolf2020.github.io/csc300x-hw3/images/ricebowl2.jpg"
                    alt="ricebowl2">
                <aside class="hide" id="ricebowl2">For a different rice bowl, get black beans with lettuce and tofu with
                    their white sauce.
                    This bowl comes out to about $7.95 and has as much flavor as the first one.
                </aside>

                    alt="hibachi">
                <aside class="hide" id="hibachi">The hibachi is also really good if you would like something with less
                    rice.
                    The steak and shrimp hibachi is the best in my opinion and comes with vegetables and fried rice.
                    The price of the hibachi plate is $10.75.
