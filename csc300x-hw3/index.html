        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Are you looking for places to eat on or near campus?
            Well I have the places for you.
            As a senior at UNCG, I have had plenty of time to survey the surrounding neighborhoods of UNCG and know the
            best places to eat.
            Some places may be a bit pricier than others but let me tell you, it'll be worth it.
            Hopefully you like these places as much as I did and be sure to recommend your friends to this blog if you
            did.</p>
